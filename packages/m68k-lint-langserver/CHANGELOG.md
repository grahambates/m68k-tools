# m68k-lint-langserver

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d29fda4: Add `suspicious/unused-global-label`, flagging a global label referenced nowhere in the project. Off by default and only checked when a project-wide reference index is available: a label with no reference the index can see may still be a linker-specified entry point or a hardware vector table entry placed by address rather than by name, neither of which is visible to source analysis. XDEF and XREF need no special handling -- their operands are ordinary symbol references, so an exported or imported name already counts as used. `_start` is exempt outright as the conventional linker entry point name.

  Add `buildProjectReferences` and thread an optional `ProjectReferences` index through `lintParsedFile`/`lintSource` and `RuleContext.projectReferences`, built from the same project scan `buildProjectSymbols` already does. Building it re-parses every project file on top of the constant index's own pass, so both the CLI and the language server now build it only when `needsProjectReferences(config)` says a live rule actually reads it -- in practice, only when `unused-global-label` itself is enabled. Project indexing overall can still be turned off with `projectSymbols: false`.

### Patch Changes

- a76bfa3: Share workspace file discovery (recursive walk, exclude-pattern matching) between the assembly and linter language servers via a new private `@m68k-lsp/workspace-files` package, instead of each maintaining its own implementation.

  No intended behaviour change for `m68k-lsp-server`. For `m68k-lint-langserver`, project indexing now respects real glob exclude patterns (previously a fixed set of skipped directory names with no way to configure it) via the same mechanism the assembly server already exposed through its own `exclude` setting; a hidden directory other than `.git` is no longer skipped unconditionally, since it is now covered by the same exclude-pattern default both servers share instead of a blanket dotfile rule.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 953e621: Offer conditional and manual-review replacements as explicitly labelled editor actions while keeping Fix All conservative by default. Make actions accessible throughout a multiline finding. Highlight the affected instruction and operands or instruction sequence when an optimization previously pointed only at its mnemonic.
- f77f9fc: Require Node.js 22.15.1 or later for Node packages and VS Code 1.101 or later for
  extensions. Builds and releases now come from the shared m68k-tools workspace.
  Existing npm and Marketplace identities are preserved.
- 87d5a19: Collapse duplicate safe optimization replacements and omit provably inferior alternatives on 68000. Group remaining safe alternatives for the same instruction sequence, preserving individual rule details and tradeoffs. CLI review supports numbered choices and VS Code offers separate code actions; automatic fixes leave grouped alternatives for the user to choose.
- 02a4260: Annotate intent-obscuring rule fixes by default using explicit rule metadata. Replace boolean fix annotation options with obfuscated, all, and none modes across the library, CLI, interactive review, and editor. Add project fixAnnotate configuration.

  Migration: replace bare `--fix-annotate` with `--fix-annotate obfuscated`. Replace boolean library and editor annotation settings with `obfuscated` (previous `true`) or `none` (previous `false`); use `all` to annotate every applied fix. Omitting the setting now defaults to rule-specific annotation.

  Classify existing rules for lost constants/expressions and opaque tricks, and expose the classification in the rule documentation. Routine idioms and multiple lines alone do not qualify.

### Patch Changes

- 1a806c9: Show CPU(read,write) cycle savings in editor diagnostics, alternative summaries and fix titles, matching the CLI. Preserve zero values and show unknown measurements as question marks; negative savings indicate increased cost.
